## About

Onde Assistir (Where to Watch) is a platform with broadcasts of sports games (mainly football), focused on the Brazilian market, with options for broadcasts on TV and the Internet.

Access the platform at: <http://ondeassistir.laerciorios.com/>

The platform emerged as an academic project in the Computer Engineering course (UEFS) in the Network Programming (WEB Programming) discipline taught by Professor Jo√£o Rocha and continued as a personal challenge and an opportunity to improve new knowledge.

For more details about the discipline, see: [EXA844](https://sites.google.com/a/ecomp.uefs.br/joao/home/courses/exa844)

Onde Assistir has an API, where all data from teams, games, and their transmissions is consumed. See more about the API in:
